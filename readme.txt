Once you upload and activate the plugin, Wordpress Guest Post will automatically create your "Add Posts" page. This is the page where you will direct article submissions.

= Where are my unapproved guest post submissions?

Click the Wordpress Guest Post link in your Wordpress Admin sidebar. You will be directed to a list of unapproved posts. Once you approve the post, it will allow you to edit the post. It is NOT live yet. After you've edited the post, you can then approve it for publishing to your blog.
